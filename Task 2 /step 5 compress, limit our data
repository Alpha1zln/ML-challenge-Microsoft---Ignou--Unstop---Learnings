This looks like a lot of code, but we can compress the important parts into a single line.

Let's do something similar: restrict our data to only those with boot sizes smaller than 40.


# Make a copy of the dataset that only contains dogs with 
# a boot size below size 40
# The call to copy() is optional but can help avoid unexpected
# behaviour in more complex scenarios
data_smaller_paws = dataset[dataset.boot_size < 40].copy()


# Print information about this
print(f"We now have {len(data_smaller_paws)} rows in our dataset. The last few rows are:")
data_smaller_paws.tail()
