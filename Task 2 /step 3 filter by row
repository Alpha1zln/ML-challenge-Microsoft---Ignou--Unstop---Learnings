Filter data by Rows
We can get data from the top of the table by using the head() function, or from the bottom of the table by using the tail() function.

Both functions make a shallow copy of a section of our dataframe. 
Here, we're sending these copies to the print() function. The head and tail views can also be used for other purposes, such as for use in analyses or graphs.


# Print the data at the top of the table
print("TOP OF TABLE")
print(dataset.head())

# print the data at the bottom of the table
print("\nBOTTOM OF TABLE")
print(dataset.tail())
