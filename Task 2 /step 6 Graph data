Graph Data
Graphing data is often the easiest way to understand it.

In these exercises, we usually make our graphs using code in a custom file we've created, called graphing.py, which you can look at on our github page.

Here, we'll practice making a graph without this custom code, however.

Lets make a simple graph of harness size versus boot size for our avalanche dogs with smaller feet.

# Load and prepare plotly to create our graphs
import plotly.express
import graphing # this is a custom file you can find in our code on github

# Show a graph of harness size by boot size:
plotly.express.scatter(data_smaller_paws, x="harness_size", y="boot_size")
