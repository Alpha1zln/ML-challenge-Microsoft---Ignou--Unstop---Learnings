Graph Data
Graphing data is often the easiest way to understand it.

In these exercises, we usually make our graphs using code in a custom file we've created, called graphing.py, which you can look at on our github page.

Here, we'll practice making a graph without this custom code, however.

Lets make a simple graph of harness size versus boot size for our avalanche dogs with smaller feet.
