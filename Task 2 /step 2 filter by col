Filter data by Columns
Data is easy to filter by columns. We can either type this directly, like dataset.my_column_name, or like so: dataset["my_column_name"].

We can use this to either extract data, or to delete data.

Lets take a look at the harness sizes, and delete the sex and age_years columns.


# Look at the harness sizes
print("Harness sizes")
print(dataset.harness_size)

# Remove the sex and age-in-years columns.
del dataset["sex"]
del dataset["age_years"]

# Print the column names
print("\nAvailable columns after deleting sex and age information:")
print(dataset.columns.values)
