# Notice how training the model set its parameters. We could interpret these directly, but it's simpler to see it as a graph:

import graphing

# Show a graph of the result
# Don't worry about how this works for now
graphing.scatter_2D(dataset,    label_x="harness_size", 
                                label_y="boot_size",
                                trendline=lambda x: fitted_model.params[1] * x + fitted_model.params[0]
                                )
