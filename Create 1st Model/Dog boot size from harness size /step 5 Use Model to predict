# models are computer code that processes information to make a prediction or a decision. 
# Here, we'll train a model to guess a comfortable boot size for a dog, based on the size of the harness that fits them.

# harness_size states the size of the harness we are interested in
harness_size = { 'harness_size' : [52.5] }

# Use the model to predict what size of boots the dog will fit
approximate_boot_size = fitted_model.predict(harness_size)

# Print the result
print("Estimated approximate_boot_size:")
print(approximate_boot_size[0])

# If you'd like, change the value of 52.5 in harness_size to a new value and run the block above to see the model in action.
