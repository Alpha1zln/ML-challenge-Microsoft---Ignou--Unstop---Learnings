# Load data with Pandas
# There are large variety of libraries that help you work with data. In Python, one of the most common is Pandas. 
# We used pandas briefly in the previous exercise. 
# Pandas can open data saved as text files and store it in an organized table called a DataFrame.

# Let's open some text data that's stored on disk. Our data is saved in a file called doggy-boot-harness.csv.

import pandas
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-introduction-to-machine-learning/main/graphing.py
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-introduction-to-machine-learning/main/Data/doggy-boot-harness.csv

# Read the text file containing data using pandas
dataset = pandas.read_csv('doggy-boot-harness.csv')

# Print the data
# Because there are a lot of data, use head() to only print the first few rows
dataset.head()
